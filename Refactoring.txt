Things to be refactored (ideas)
- Ipv4Address and Ipv6Address should be replaced by QHostAddress (reduce MUDA)
- Create a tribool class to replace boost tribool (dependancy reduction)
- Change the way we manage Energy (Acpi in opus lib) in order to replace usage of boost::function (dependancy reduction)
- Merge opus lib needed classes into this repository (dependancy reduction)
